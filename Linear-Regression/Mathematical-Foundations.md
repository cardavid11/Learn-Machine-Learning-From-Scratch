### Mathematical Foundations of Linear Regression

In the world of data science and predictive modeling, Linear Regression stands as a foundational pillar. Understanding its mathematical foundations is crucial, not only for building accurate models but also for acing data science interviews. In this section, we'll delve into the mathematical aspects of Linear Regression, covering key concepts and elements that every aspiring data scientist should know.

#### Model Equation: Simple Linear Regression

At the core of Linear Regression lies a straightforward equation:

# $`Y = b0 + b1*X`$ 

- **Y:** Represents the dependent variable, often referred to as the target or response variable.
- **X:** Denotes the independent variable, also known as the predictor.
- **b0 (Intercept):** It's the starting point of the regression line, where the line intersects the Y-axis when X is zero.
- **b1 (Slope):** This coefficient signifies the rate of change in Y concerning a one-unit change in X.

#### The Least Squares Method

Linear Regression aims to find the best-fit line that minimizes the sum of squared differences (residuals) between the observed values and the predicted values. The least squares method achieves this by minimizing the following objective function:

# Minimize $`Σ(yi - ŷi)^2`$  


- **yi:** Represents the observed values of the dependent variable.
- **ŷi:** Corresponds to the predicted values generated by the regression line.

#### Coefficient Estimation

Determining the coefficients (b0 and b1) is a fundamental step in Linear Regression. Here's how they are estimated:

- **b1 (Slope):** It's calculated as the covariance of X and Y divided by the variance of X:

# $`b1 = Cov(X, Y) / Var(X)`$

- **b0 (Intercept):** Once b1 is calculated, you can find b0 using the mean values of X and Y:

# $`b0 = Ȳ - b1 * X̄`$


#### Residuals and Goodness of Fit

Residuals represent the vertical distance between each data point and the regression line. They're essential for assessing the model's goodness of fit. Key aspects include:

- **Residuals (εi):** The differences between observed values (yi) and predicted values (ŷi).
- **Sum of Squared Residuals (SSE):** It quantifies the total error in the model.
- **Coefficient of Determination (R-squared):** It measures the proportion of variance explained by the model, typically between 0 and 1.

#### Assumptions in Linear Regression

Linear Regression relies on several assumptions for accurate modeling. Being aware of these assumptions is crucial:

1. **Linearity:** The relationship between X and Y should be linear.
2. **Independence of Residuals:** Residuals should be independent of each other.
3. **Homoscedasticity:** The variance of residuals should be constant across all levels of X.
4. **Normality of Residuals:** Residuals should follow a normal distribution.

#### Multicollinearity

When dealing with multiple independent variables (multiple linear regression), multicollinearity can be an issue. It occurs when predictor variables are highly correlated. Understanding and detecting multicollinearity is essential to maintain model accuracy.
