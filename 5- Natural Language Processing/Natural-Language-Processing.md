# Natural Language Processing (NLP):

## Traditional NLP Models:
- Tokenization, Stemming, and Lemmatization
- Bag of Words (BoW)
- Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)

## Word Embeddings:
- Word2Vec
- GloVe
- FastText

## Sequence Models:
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)

## Transformer Models:
- BERT
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
- T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
