# Predicting a Baseball Player's Future Batting Average

In baseball, a player's **batting average** is one of the key statistics to measure their offensive performance. The batting average is calculated as the number of hits divided by the number of at-bats. Teams and analysts may be interested in predicting a player's future batting average based on their past performance, such as the number of runs they've scored in a season. Can we predict a player's batting average in the next season based on the number of runs they scored in the current season?
