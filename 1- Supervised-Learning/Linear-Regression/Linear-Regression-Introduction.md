### Key Concepts and Mathematics

Welcome to the "Key Concepts and Mathematics" section of our Linear Regression chapter. In this section, we will explore the foundational concepts and mathematical principles that underlie the theory of linear regression.

#### Simple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression is the fundamental building block of linear regression models. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. Here are the key concepts:

- **Model Equation:** The simple linear regression model is represented as `Y = b0 + b1*X`, where:
  - `Y` is the dependent variable (target).
  - `X` is the independent variable (predictor).
  - `b0` is the intercept (the value of `Y` when `X` is zero).
  - `b1` is the slope (the change in `Y` for a one-unit change in `X`).

- **Least Squares Method:** The model finds the best-fit line by minimizing the sum of squared differences between predicted and actual values.

#### Mathematics and Formulas

To understand linear regression deeply, we need to delve into the mathematics behind it. Here are some essential mathematical aspects:

- **Coefficient Estimation:** Learn how to estimate the coefficients `b0` and `b1` in simple linear regression and extend this concept to multiple linear regression.

- **Residuals:** Understand the concept of residuals (`Îµi`) and how they are used in the least squares method.

- **Assumptions:** Explore the key assumptions of linear regression, including linearity, independence of residuals, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals.
