# Model Evaluation for Linear Regression

Model evaluation for linear regression is a process that assesses the performance and accuracy of a linear regression model in predicting the target variable. Linear regression is a supervised learning technique used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more independent variables (features).

**Key Concepts:**

- **Regression Metrics:** Model evaluation for linear regression typically uses specific metrics suitable for regression problems. Common regression metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R²), and Adjusted R-squared.

**Common Regression Metrics:**

- *Mean Absolute Error (MAE):* MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE.

- *Mean Squared Error (MSE):* MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It gives more weight to larger errors.

- *Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):* RMSE is the square root of MSE and provides an interpretable measure of prediction error in the same units as the target variable.

- *R-squared (R²):* R-squared represents the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the linear regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better model fit.

- *Adjusted R-squared:* Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that accounts for the number of features in the model. It penalizes the inclusion of irrelevant features.

**Interpreting Regression Metrics:**

- Lower values of MAE, MSE, and RMSE indicate better model accuracy, with a preference for smaller errors.

- Higher R-squared values suggest that the model explains a larger portion of the variance in the target variable, indicating a better fit.

- Adjusted R-squared helps assess model complexity by considering the trade-off between adding more features and improving model fit.

**Cross-Validation:**

- Cross-validation is a common practice in model evaluation for linear regression. It involves partitioning the dataset into training and testing sets multiple times to obtain more reliable performance estimates.

**Residual Analysis:**

- Residual analysis is another technique used in model evaluation. Residuals are the differences between the predicted and actual target values. A good linear regression model should have residuals that are randomly distributed around zero, without any clear patterns.

**Visualization:**

- Visualization techniques, such as scatterplots, can be used to compare predicted values to actual values. These visualizations provide insights into the model's performance and highlight areas where it may need improvement.

Model evaluation for linear regression aims to provide a clear understanding of how well the model predicts the target variable and whether it meets the desired level of accuracy for the specific problem. The choice of evaluation metrics depends on the problem and the nature of the data.
