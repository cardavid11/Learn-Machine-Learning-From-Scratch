    "#What is cross-validation?\n",
    "# In cross-validation, we run our modeling process on different subsets of the data to get multiple measures of model quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example, we could begin by dividing the data into 5 pieces, each 20% of the full dataset. In this case, we say that we have broken the data into 5 \"folds\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#When should you use cross-validation?Â¶\n",
    "#Cross-validation gives a more accurate measure of model quality, which is especially important if you are making a lot of modeling decisions. However, it can take longer to run, because it estimates multiple models (one for each fold).\n",
    "\n",
    "#So, given these tradeoffs, when should you use each approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "#For small datasets, where extra computational burden isn't a big deal, you should run cross-validation.\n",
    "#For larger datasets, a single validation set is sufficient. Your code will run faster, and you may have enough data that there's little need to re-use some of it for holdout."
